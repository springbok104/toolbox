ðŸ§µ Stitching things together, quietly

A collection of purpose-built scripts for workflows that shouldâ€™ve just worked.

## Scripts

### `tm_sparsebundle.sh`
# bash-scripts

Minimal tools, quietly confident logic.

## Scripts

### `tm_sparsebundle.sh`

Time Machine can be fickle.  
This script was built after having to manually create sparsebundle imagesâ€”multiple timesâ€”due to backup errors and quirks in Time Machine behavior.

Creates a Time Machine-compatible sparsebundle for network or local backups.  
Prompts user for volume name, size, and destination directory.  
Includes input validation, fallback logic, and directory checks.

> Designed for reproducibility. Works on macOS.
